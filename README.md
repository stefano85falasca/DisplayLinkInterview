Platform
======
The code has been tried and tested on various versions of ubuntu.

I don't have a Windows machine available, so I have not tried it on Windows.

Usage
======
* clone
* update submodules with `git submodule update --init --recursive`
* have cmake generate the build system
  * initial caches can be found, if desired, in src/cmake
* compile

Testing
======
Several test programs are generated during build
* testcommonlib
* testtslib
* testcommon
